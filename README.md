# Maps hackdays example notebooks 

## What?
This repository contains a numberof notebooks produced as part of the living with machines project for a series of "hackdays" on working with maps at scale. 

These notebooks are shared an artefact of the Living with Machines projects working process, and are unlikely to be useful for very much else in their current state. We are busy working on outputs based on much of this work which should be avalable soon™️

These notebooks were largely produced in preparation for two hackdays described in this blog post !todo add link . A couple of notebooks show outputs produced during the hackdays themselves. 

Both of these hackdays had the aim of trying to explore what was possible to do with computer vision and digised historical maps (at scale).

## Contents 
The first hackday, "proof by pixel" focused on "traditional" computer vision methods, as well as covering some basics of working with images in Python. This includes notes on images as 'matrix of numbers', accessing summary stats about images, convolutions, edge detection etc. 

The second hackday focused on developing an approach to "object detection" using deep learning methods, with a intro to deep-learning, building training sets etc. 

The notebooks and hackdays were intended to be part of a learning process which would help us develop evaluate potential research directons in an semi-efficient, and moderetly enjoyable way. The releative merits of this approach are discussed in the blog post.
