- For working with these notebooks locally you will need to make sure you have Azcopy insalled. This will differ depending on the computer you use. 
- The pigeon tool for annotation only works in Jupyter notebooks not Jupyter labs ☹️
- You can find a conda environment which *should* contain all the python packages you need.
