This isn't exhaustive but some things which we need to have an awareness of for the analysis work we will be doing in the hack day and for the subsequent sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pixels\n",
    "You will probably be familar with the concept of pixels from having seen bad quality images\n",
    "- ['Images on computers are stored as rectangular arrays of hundreds, thousands, or millions of discrete “picture elements,” otherwise known as pixels. Each pixel can be thought of as a single square point of colored light.'](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/02-image-basics/)\n",

    "[\"In digital photography, computer-generated imagery, and colorimetry, a grayscale or greyscale image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light, that is, it carries only intensity information. Grayscale images, a kind of black-and-white or gray monochrome, are composed exclusively of shades of gray. The contrast ranges from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale)\n",

    "## Formats\n",
    "There are loads of different image formats we might come accross 'in the wild' but for our purposes there are a few main ones to be aware of when working with maps. \n",

    "- Identified by .tif or .tiff extension\n",
    "- The TIFF format is a common format for storing uncompressed images that is often the output from digitsation, cameras and consumer scanners.  \n",
    "- TIFF files are often big. In the case of maps they are especially big (~600MB) which can make them difficult to work with without some pre-processing work. \n",
    "- Some imaging libraries can have problems working with TIFF images. Usually Python libraries rely on [libtiff](http://www.libtiff.org/) so if you are having a problems loading TIFF images you may want to start by checking your system has libtiff installed/available. \n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoTIFF\n",
    "- GeoTIFF is an extension of TIFF which allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF file. [The potential additional information includes map projection, coordinate systems, ellipsoids, datums, and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file. The GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with TIFF 6.0, so software incapable of reading and interpreting the specialized metadata will still be able to open a GeoTIFF format file.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF)\n",
    "- Some of the maps we have been given by NLS \n",
    "\n",
    "### JPEG\n",
    "- Usually identfied by .jpg or .jpeg extensions \n",
    "- A lossy compression format often used for sharing images online \n",
    "- This format is also commmonly used and is often used as a format for sharing images.\n",
    "- A JPEG format will contain less information than a TIFF file but will also be smaller. In the second hack day we will see that this loss of detail isn't always important. \n"
